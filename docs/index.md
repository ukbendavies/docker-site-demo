# Deploying a new documentation site using Containers

!!! Abstract
    This site builds a small body of knowledge for my research into deploying Docker Containers that are hosted on the [Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/) flavor of [KubernetesÂ®](https://kubernetes.io/).  

    In addition mkdocs is used for presentation and hosted on a small nginx Docker image as the base layer.  

    Research topics covered in this demo:  
    [![Docker](images/docker-horizontal.png)](https://www.docker.com/)  
    [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)  
    [Microsoft Azure AKS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/)  
    [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/)
